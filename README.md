Description: 
The purpose of this message board project was to learn authentication and password encryption. The app provides users with varying levels of permission based on their member status. When no user is logged in only the post's content and title is visible. In order to post on the message board a user must create an account. In order to view the author and timestamp of posts, the user must have member status. Member status can be gained by using the passcode "bikes" when creating an account. Admin status is gained by using the passcode "moreBikes" during profile creation, and provides the user with the ability to delete posts.
